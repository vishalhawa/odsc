# Presentation for ODSC East 

ODSC - East 
Workshop on Multi-channel optimal path sequencing through Bayesian Deep Learning

## Prerequisites 
R- Ecosystem has well kept pace with the development on tensorflow / Deep Learning by providing interface to Python installable. Statisticians who want to take advantage of Deep Learning / TF, this workshop can offer a good way to get started.

## Requirements 
-	R Language / data structures / data-table
-	Library keras , tensorflow , tfdatasets, data.table,  
-	R tensorflow and tensorflow probability be installed and working on the local system.
-	refer : https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation/  and https://rstudio.github.io/tfprobability/
-	Data Needs : Will simulated data, if any other will be advised

## Files
- simulate_data : generate data for the model
- tf_rnn : tensorflow RNN model for sequence as classifier in R-ecosystem
- tfp_rnn_vae_iso : tensorflow probability model for VAE with isotropic gaussian
- tfp_rnn_vae_lp : tensorflow probability model for VAE with learnable prior as mixture of gaussians
- utils : Utility functions supportive needs
