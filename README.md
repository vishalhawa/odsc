# Presentation for ODSC East 

ODSC - East 
Workshop on Multi-channel optimal path sequencing through Bayesian Deep Learning

Prerequisites 
R- Ecosystem has well kept pace with the development on tensorflow / Deep Learning by providing interface to Python installable. Statisticians who want to take advantage of Deep Learning / TF, this workshop can offer a good way to get started.

Requirements 
•	R Language / data structures / data-table
•	Library keras , tensorflow , tfdatasets, data.table,  
•	R tensorflow and tensorflow probability be installed and working on the local system.
•	refer : https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation/  and https://rstudio.github.io/tfprobability/
•	Data Needs : Will simulated data, if any other will be advised
